    """Return a list all Python packages found within directory 'where'

    'where' is the root directory which will be searched for packages.  It
    should be supplied as a "cross-platform" (i.e. URL-style) path; it will
    be converted to the appropriate local path syntax.

    'exclude' is a sequence of package names to exclude; '*' can be used
    as a wildcard in the names, such that 'foo.*' will exclude all
    subpackages of 'foo' (but not 'foo' itself).

    'include' is a sequence of package names to include.  If it's
    specified, only the named packages will be included.  If it's not
    specified, all found packages will be included.  'include' can contain
    shell style wildcard patterns just like 'exclude'.
